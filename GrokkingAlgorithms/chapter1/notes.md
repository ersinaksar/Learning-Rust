# Binary Search
- The instructions required to complete a task are called algorithms.
- The entries of the binary search are a sorted list of elements.
- If the element you are looking for is in this list, the binary returns the position of where the search element is located, otherwise it returns null.
- With binary search, you guess the number in the middle and eliminate half of the remaining numbers each time.
- In the worst-case scenario, the step at which binary search would work would be log2n (n on the basis of logarithm 2).

# Logarithms
- If we take a brief look at what logarithms are, log10(100), to find the value of 100 at the base log 10, we look at how many powers of the number 10 are equal to the number 100. Since the 2nd power of the number 10 is 100, log10(100) = 2. In general, when we say logn, it means log2n, which means n at the base of logarithm 2.
